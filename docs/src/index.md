# TypedMatrices.jl Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for TypedMatrices.jl.

An extensible Julia matrix collection utilizing type system to enhance performance.

Check [Getting Started](@ref) for a quick start.

## Features

- Matrix Types: Types representing special matrices that can be used for algorithm testing or other computations.
- Linear Algebra Operations: Operations are fine-tuned to enhance the performance of these matrix types.
- Matrix Properties (Tags): Users can add properties (tags) to matrices, which can be used for organization or computation.
- Matrix Grouping: Matrices can be grouped together depending on types or properties, with the flexibility for users to define their own types.
- Filtering by Properties/Groups: Matrices can be filtered by property or group for more targeted computations.
