# Testing Algorithms

```@setup testing-algorithms
using TypedMatrices
```

This section presents a standardized methodology for testing algorithms using the `TypedMatrices` package.

## Algorithm Development

Consider, for example, a simple algorithm that computes the sum of all elements in a matrix. This algorithm is implemented in the function `sum_elements` as follows:

```@repl testing-algorithms
function sum_elements(A::AbstractMatrix)
    return sum(A)
end
```

## Algorithm Testing

To test the algorithm, use the [`test_algorithm`](@ref) function. This function accepts the algorithm as its first argument and a vector of matrix sizes as its second argument. Additionally, it supports optional arguments to specify matrix properties and error handling behavior.

For example, to test the `sum_elements` algorithm on symmetric and positive definite matrices of sizes 1 through 4, with known eigenvalues and inverse, one can invoke the following:

```@repl testing-algorithms
test_algorithm(
    sum_elements,
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    props=[
        Property(:symmetric), Property(:posdef),
        Property(:eigen), Property(:inverse)
    ],
    errors_as_warnings=true
)
```

In this example, the first two arguments specify the target algorithm and the set of matrix sizes to test, respectively. The `props` keyword argument defines the properties of matrices. The `errors_as_warnings` flag determines whether runtime errors should be reported as warnings instead of causing test failure.

The function returns a vector of tuples, each containing three elements: the matrix type, the matrix size, and the corresponding output from the algorithm under test.

## Performance and Memory Profiling

In many cases, it is desirable to capture performance metrics such as execution time and memory allocation alongside the algorithmâ€™s output. To facilitate this, the algorithm can be modified accordingly:

```@repl testing-algorithms
function sum_elements(A::AbstractMatrix)
    result = @timed sum(A)
    return result.value, result.time, result.bytes
end

test_algorithm(
    sum_elements,
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    props=[
        Property(:symmetric), Property(:posdef),
        Property(:eigen), Property(:inverse)
    ],
    errors_as_warnings=true
)
```
